# folklore-scraper
A simple java program that implements JSOUP to crawl folklore.org and scrape up stories. 
 * The Folklore Scaper is a basic crawler and scraper implementation using JSOUP to save all the stories on folklore.org to    offline devices. folklore.org contains stories 
 * documented by Andy Hertzfeld about the original Macintosh team and served as a source of inspiration for Walter Issacson for his book about Steve Jobs. 
 * I was afraid Hertzfeld might take his site down, hence I had coded this little program.
 * Please replace Simple FileWriter with PDFBOX implementation to save files in .pdf format
